# PROGRESS_SpecificGravity_MultipleImputation

R scripts to perform multiple imputation (using the mice package in R) for missing specific gravity values within the PROGRESS cohort. Imputed values will be used to adjust for specific gravity in analyses using chemicals measured in urine (e.g., phthalates)
